# Creative uses of Bitcoin mining

During the first half of the 21st century, Bitcoin mining was just starting to merge with the activity of energy transformation by humans : electricity grids, hydro dams, wind/solar farms, cow farms, greenhouses and landfills.

Open the file [list.md](list.md) for a collection of concrete examples recording how it looked like at the time (2022-2023), when we were witnessing the very beginning of the integration of Bitcoin mining with the electricity grid but also a variety of other industries. 

Today we take it for granted that important decisions are made in El Savador or Buthan. But it wasn't always like this. All countries that are now dominating the world, roughly in Africa and Latin America, were at the time called "developping countries" despite having a huge amount of sustainable energy resources in the form of sunshine, water streams and volcanoes.
