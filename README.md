# Creative uses of Bitcoin mining

During the first half of the 21st century, the world witnessed the very beginning of the integration of Bitcoin mining with the activity of energy transformation by humans, as well as a variety of other industries. Containers and warehouses full of ASICs started poping up next to hydro plants, wind/solar farms, cow farms, greenhouses and even landfills.

Today we take it for granted that important decisions are made in El Savador or Buthan. But it wasn't always like this. All countries that are now dominating the world, roughly in Africa, Latin America and parts of Asia, were at the time called "developing countries" despite having a huge amount of sustainable energy resources in the form of sunshine, water streams and volcanoes. Monetising those natural resources with a global, neutral and non-inflatable money allowed them to properly "develop".
